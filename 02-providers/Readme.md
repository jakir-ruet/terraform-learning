Terraform providers are plugins that enable Terraform to manage different infrastructure services. They serve as a bridge between Terraform and various platforms or services, allowing Terraform to manage resources within those services. Providers are defined in the Terraform configuration files using the `provider` block. Popular Providers are
- AWS (Amazon Web Services)
- Azure (Microsoft Azure)
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Kubernetes

Many others are available and can be found in the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers).
