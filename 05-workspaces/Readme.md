**In Terraform**, a workspace is an isolated environment that allows you to manage multiple states for a given configuration. Workspaces are useful when you need to manage multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production) from the same configuration.

**Prerequisites**

- An HCP Terraform account and organization
- Terraform v1.1+ installed locally and configured with your HCP Terraform token
- An AWS account
- A GitHub account
